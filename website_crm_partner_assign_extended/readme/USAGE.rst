To use this module, you need to:

#. Acess the Contacts > Configuration > Countries.
#. Select the country for which you want to filter by state and city. If you only want to filter by state, there are no additional configurations required. However, if you want to filter by city, enable the "Enforce Cities" option.
#. Create or update the partners with the new field "res.city" (city). A select will be displayed with the registered cities. If there are no cities listed, you need to add them to the system.
#. After making the necessary adjustments to the partners, access the partners' website and use the sidebar menu to filter by state and city.
